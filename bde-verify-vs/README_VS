This directory contains the source for a Visual Studio Extension Package that
runs BDE Verify on the active C++ text buffer within the IDE and places the
resulting messages into the error list.  These messages can be double-clicked
to navigate to their corresponding source code.

Building the solution file BdeVerify.sln produces the file
./BdeVerify/bin/Release/BdeVerify.vsix, which can be double-clicked to
install the extension into Visual Studio.  Once installed, a BDE Verify section
appears within the TOOLS/Options... menu, in which custom settings may be
specified.  If BDE Verify has been installed via the installer package, the
extension packages will locate the executable and config files automatically.
They can in any case be set manually.
